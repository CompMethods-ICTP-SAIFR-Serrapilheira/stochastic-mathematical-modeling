# Stochastic Mathematical Modeling
## Evolutionary Dynamics: The Moran Model

This project intents to investigate concepts in evolutionary dynamics, specially biological effects that arise from stochasticy, such as Neutral drift.
The goal is to study the Moran model and get intuition of its behaviour and biological implications. 

In order to do so, the project is based on computational simulations of the model performed in R and Python.  

## Project structure

The project's folder structure is organized as shown below. In the `R` and in the `Python` directory you will find the scripts. The `docs` contains the short report of the project
and in `figs` you can find all the resulting figures. 


```
